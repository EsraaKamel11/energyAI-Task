=== ML Pipeline Summary (Enhanced Version with CI/CD, Docker & Monitoring) ===
Processed documents: 10
Domain: electric_vehicles
Base model: microsoft/DialoGPT-medium
Training method: QLoRA (4-bit quantization)
Output directory: ml_pipeline/pipeline_output

=== Pipeline Stages ===
✓ Data Collection (sample data)
✓ Data Processing
✓ Data Cleaning
✓ Quality Filtering
✓ Normalization
✓ Deduplication
✓ QA Generation (sample data)
✓ QLoRA Fine-tuning
✓ Model Evaluation
✓ Enhanced Model Deployment

=== Infrastructure Status ===
CI/CD Setup: ✓ (.github/workflows/ml-pipeline.yml)
Docker Setup: ✓ (ml_pipeline/docker/Dockerfile, ml_pipeline/docker-compose.monitoring.yml)
Monitoring Setup: ⚠ (ml_pipeline/monitoring/, ml_pipeline/start_monitoring.py)

=== QLoRA Benefits ===
• 75% less memory usage than LoRA
• Works on consumer GPUs (8GB+ VRAM)
• Maintains good performance
• Modular, maintainable architecture

=== Enhanced Monitoring Access ===
• Enhanced Inference Server: http://localhost:8000
• API Metrics: http://localhost:8000/metrics
• Health Check: http://localhost:8000/health
• Grafana Dashboard: http://localhost:3000
• Prometheus Metrics: http://localhost:9090
• Alertmanager: http://localhost:9093

=== New Features ===
• Docker containerization support
• GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
• Enhanced monitored inference server
• Pre-configured Grafana dashboards
• Prometheus alerting rules
• Comprehensive monitoring stack

=== Next Steps ===
1. Test the fine-tuned model via API
2. Monitor performance via Grafana
3. Set up alerts in Alertmanager
4. Configure CI/CD pipeline triggers
5. Deploy to production with Docker
6. Scale with Kubernetes (optional)
